            <p>Hello friends, my name is Juan Leyva. My major is business, but I plan to change to software development.</p>
            <p>I am from Trujillo, a city north of Lima, Peru. I have three children and four grandchildren. I hold a degree in physics sciences.</p>
            <p>I have never had a severe problem with technology, so I have always used Office programs. But When I have a problem, I try to solve it by myself first. If I can not solve it, I ask some friends with more experience.</p>
